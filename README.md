Overview - Investment Tax Relief 
--------------------------------

Investment Tax Relief (ITR) include The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR) and Venture Capital Trusts (VCT). 

The EIS and SEIS schemes encourage equity investment in small and medium size companies that have traditionally struggled to obtain financing whilst the newer SITR scheme aims to encourage equity and debt investment in socially beneficial projects. EIS, SEIS and SITR schemes incentivise investment by giving tax reliefs (both Income Tax and Capital Gains Tax) to qualifying individual investors. These schemes attract a high level of political interest with their use actively encouraged by a number of Government Ministers and politicians and are a part of the Government's growth and 'Big Society' agendas. VCT operates a similar process though the customer base is Investment trust driven.

The user population is made up of mainly UK based, but some non-UK based limited companies and charities and agents acting on their behalf.

The investment tax relief services are the represent the realisation of a digital service the above.
Features will be added and enhanced over time.
